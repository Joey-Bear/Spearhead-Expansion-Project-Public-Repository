# Spearhead Expansion Project
 
Groups and organisations in this modification feature a mixture of those drawn from real world history as well as a number that are works of fiction.

The Spearhead Expansion Project (SEP) is focused on fleshing out the available factions in the Spearhead 1944 CDLC by adding entirely new factions such as the Afrika Korps and Royal Altian Regiment, or adding sub-factions such as the Volkssturm and early war Wehrmacht.. This modification uses the Spearhead 1944 CDLC and SPEX - Spearhead Extended from Heavy Ordnance Works. These are essential to SEP, and we are immensely appreciative for the fantastic work they have done.
