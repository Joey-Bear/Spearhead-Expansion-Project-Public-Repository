# Spearhead-Expansion-Project-Public-Repository
The Spearhead Expansion Project (SEP) is focused on fleshing out the available factions in the Spearhead 1944 CDLC. This modification uses the Spearhead 1944 from Heavy Ordnance Works. It is essential to SEP, and we are immensely appreciative for the fantastic work they have done.
